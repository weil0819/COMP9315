Visibility of tuples to PostgreSQL transactions (tx) is
determined by Transaction, Command and Tuple IDs ...

Each Transaction is allocated a global unique txID

Transaction = sequence of Commands C_1, C_2, C_3
Command     = one SQL statement

Each Command is allocated a cmdID, unique within current tx

Each tuple contains:
* xmin = transaction ID of tx that created the tuple
* xmax = transaction ID of tx that deleted the tuple
* cmin = command ID of cmd that created the tuple
* cmax = command ID of cmd that deleted the tuple
* ctid = Tuple ID of newer version of this tuple

Each command knows:
* Tc   = transaction ID of current tx
* Cc   = command ID of current cmd





Simplified view of "live" tuples ...

* xmin < Tc && xmax == NULL
* xmin == Tc && cmin < Cc
* xmax == Tc && cmax > Cc

Simplified view of "dead" tuples ...

* xmax != NULL && xmax < Tc
* xmax == Tc && cmax < Cc







More realistic view of tuple visibility includes Command ...

Possible states for tuples:

* visible,  newly-created,  updated,  deleted


PostgreSQL recognises that a tuple is deleted ...

* xmax == Tc and cmax < Cc, or
* xmax < Tc and xmax is committed

PostgreSQL recognises that a tuple is visible ...

* not deleted, and
  * created by an earlier command in Tc, or
  * created by an already-committed transaction
