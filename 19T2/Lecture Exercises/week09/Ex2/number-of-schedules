Consider n transactions:

T1, T2, ... Tn

How many possible serial schedules are there?

Some possible schedules:

T1 T2 ... Tn
Tn ... T2 T1
T2 T1 ... Tn

So, the question is, how many different orderings?

# possible schedules = n!



Consider 2 transactions:

Ta: R(X) R(Y) W(X) W(Y)
Tb: R(Y) W(Y) R(X) W(X)

The objects don't matter in counting schedules.
The order of operations does matter.

Rename the ops as:

Ta: a1 a2 a3 a4
Tb: b1 b2 b3 b4

Some possible schedules:

a1 a2 a3 a4 b1 b2 b3 b4
b1 b2 b3 b4 a1 a2 a3 a4
a1 b1 a2 b2 a3 b3 a4 b4
b1 a1 b2 a2 b3 a3 b4 a4
etc. etc.

At each step:
* we have a "current" op
* we have two choices for "next" op
  - "next" op in this tx
  - "next" op in other tx

So ...
* initially no "current" op
* "next" op in Ta is a1, "next" op in Tb is b1
* choose either a1 or b1
* if first op is a1, second op is either a2 or b1
* if first op is b1, second op is either a1 or b2
* etc. etc.

There are 8 ops overall.
The first 7 each have two choices.
The last has only one choice (the remaining op).

Number of schedules: 2^7

Left as an exercise ...

Number of schedules for k tx's, each with n ops
