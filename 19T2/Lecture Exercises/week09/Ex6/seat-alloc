Need to ensure that no "conflicting" access to the
SeatAlloc table happens.

The possible conflict:
* two tx's read simultaneously and both find the seat empty
* both then proceed to give the same seat to two different pax's

We need to ensure that only one tx at a time can access SeatAlloc.

One way:

LOCK TABLE SeatAlloc
- gives exclusive access to the SeatAlloc table
- solves problem, but locks out updates on all other flights

Would be nice to be able to only lock attempts to allocate
seats for this flight or even better just lock concurrent
attempts on this seat.

A better way:

SELECT ... FOR UPDATE
- gives exclusive access to the seat allocation in question


First approach ...

create or replace function
    allocSeat(paxID int, fltID int, seat text) returns boolean
as $$
declare
    pid int;
begin
    SELECT paxID into pid from SeatingAlloc
    where  flightID = fltID and seatNum = seat;
    if (pid is null) then
        update SeatingAlloc set pax = paxID
        where  flightID = fltID and seatNum = seat;
    end if;
	return (pid is null);
end;
$$ language plpgsql;

BEGIN;
LOCK TABLE SeatAlloc;
select allocSeat(...)
COMMIT;


Second approach ...

create or replace function
    allocSeat(paxID int, fltID int, seat text) returns boolean
as $$
declare
    avail boolean;
begin
    SELECT count(*)=1 into avail from SeatsAvail
    where  flightID = fltID and seatNum = seat
	FOR UPDATE;
    if (avail) then
        update SeatingAlloc set pax = paxID
        where  flightID = fltID and seatNum = seat;
		-- COMMIT;
    end if;
	return avail;
end;
$$ language plpgsql;
