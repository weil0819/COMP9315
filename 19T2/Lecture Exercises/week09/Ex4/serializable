(A) Consider the schedule:

T1:        W(B)  W(A)
T2:  R(B)                    W(A)
T3:                    R(A)        W(A)


Conflict Equivalence
====================

Check precedence graph ...

conflict on B between T1 and T2: T2 --> T1
conflict on A between T1 and T3: T1 --> T3
conflict on A between T2 and T3: T3 --> T2
conflict on A between T2 and T3: T2 --> T3

This graph has a cycle T1 --> T3 --> T2 --> T1
so the schedule is not conflict serializable

Also, a simpler cycle T3 --> T2 --> T3


T1:        W(B)  W(A)
T2:  R(B)                    W(A)
T3:                    R(A)        W(A)


View Equivalence
================

For each shared object:
- determine first reader
- determine last writer
- determine which version is read by each Ti

S1 ...
T1:        W(B)  W(A)
T2:  R(B)                    W(A)
T3:                    R(A)        W(A)

is view-equivalent to

S2 ...
T1:              W(B)  W(A)
T2:  R(B)  W(A)
T3:                          R(A)  W(A)

which is obviously a serial schedule

"Proof" of view equivalence:

S1 ...
B first reader T2, last writer T1
A first reader T3, last writer T3, T3 reads T1's A

S2 ...
B first reader T2, last writer T1
A first reader T3, last writer T3, T3 reads T1's A





(B) Consider the schedule:

T1:        W(B)  W(A)
T2:  R(B)              W(A)
T3:                          R(A)  W(A)

Conflict Equavalence
====================

Check precedence graph ...

* there is a conflict between T1 and T2 on B with T2 --> T1
* there is a conflict between T1 and T2 on A with T1 --> T2

This graph has a cycle T1 --> T2 --> T1
so the schedule is not conflict serializable



View Equivalence
================

For each shared object:
- determine first reader (which tx reads initial value)
- determine last writer (which tx writes the last value)
- determine which version is read by each Ti

S1 ...

T1:        W(B)  W(A)
T2:  R(B)              W(A)
T3:                          R(A)  W(A)

For B, first reader is T2, last writer is T1
For A, first reader is T3, last writer is T3
       T3 reads the value of A written by T1


There are six possible serial schedules

T1T2T3, T1T3T2, T2T1T3, T2T3T1, T3T1T2, T3T2T1

The only schedules that have the property
   T3 reads the value of A written by T2
are those where T2 comes before T3
i.e. T1T2T3, T2T3T1 

Of these, the only schedules that have the property
   last writer of A is T3
are T1T2T3

This schedule also has the property
   first reader of A is T3

T1T2T3 is not view equivalent because
   T2 reads the version of B produced by T1
whereas in schedule S1
   T2 reads the initial value of B

Thus, there is no serial schedule that has all of
the same read/write properties for shared variables
as S1 does
=> S1 is not view-equivalent to any serial schedule
=> S1 is not view serializable
